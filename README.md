# POS-System

## -DELETE ME EVENTUALLY-
#### React App is in folder 'pos-app'
* Apparently you can't have capital letters in React App names, so I had to create a new app inside the main folder.
* This is actually helpful because we can test/develop components without having to go through all the work of using them with react.
* Just remember to cd into the pos-app folder before you run yarn start.
